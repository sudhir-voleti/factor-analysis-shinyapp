# p("Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower 
# number of unobserved variables called factors. For example, it is possible that variations in four observed variables mainly reflect the variations 
# in two unobserved variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables 
# are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus error terms. The information gained about the interdependencies between 
# observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Computationally this technique is equivalent to low rank 
# approximation of the matrix of observed variables. Factor analysis originated in psychometrics, and is used in behavioral sciences, social sciences,
# marketing, product management, operations research, and other applied sciences that deal with large quantities of data.",align="justify"),
